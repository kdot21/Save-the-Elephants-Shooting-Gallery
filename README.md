# Save-the-Elephants-Shooting-Gallery
Building a shooting gallery game in which the player attempts to stop the illegal ivory trade by shooting the poachers before they can shoot the elephants

Name of project: Save the Elephants Shooting Gallery (working title)  

Description: This game is based on the classic carnival shooting gallery. Instead of solely having targets to shoot at, there will also be targets that will diminish the player's score when hit. The theme of the game will be based on the illegal ivory trade and the goal will be to shoot the poachers in order to save the elephants.  

Rules: It will be a 1 player game, but if I have time I will attempt to make it a 2 player game that compares scores at the end of each round and declares a winner. Hitting the poacher targets will increase player score and hitting the elephants will decrease the score. It will be a point and click style game.  

Technology:  
HTML/CSS to create my game environment and game appearance 
Flexbox for the positioning of the game elements and the overall game environment 
JQuery for my game animations, and target manipulation 
JS to control the game's logic and flow
